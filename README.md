# dBank 

This repository replicates the example dApp from the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWFba_9QYmc&t=5417s) about decentralised app development with Solidity/Truffle/Ganache.  

The dApp consists of a bank where users can deposit ETH and earn interest in a new token DBC (decentralised bank currency).

# Web3.js vs ethers.js

The frontent website in the tutorial was created in react using the Web3.js library, I have been working on updating this to the ethers.js library for forward compatibility, which can be found in the ethers branch of the repository.
